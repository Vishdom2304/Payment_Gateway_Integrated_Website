           Orphanage, a place where children without parents are housed and cared. Orphanages care for these children until they can be properly adopted. Generally, people think that children end up in orphanages due to loss/death of
           parents but globally, this is not the only reason. Children get separated from their parents due to poverty too, which restricts parents from giving there child the care he/she needs. Although, it's really true that Orphan children require affection, they need people they can look up to and a sense of emotional security.

            Providing all these things naturally and ideally may not be perfect, but the physical shelter, the care provided, the support in the orphanages is indeed a help and a benifit to these children and so, on the whole supporting an orphange in really good thing to do. <br>
            We, at our foundation, collect funds donated by some really kind people and use them for the betterment of these 
            children. We aim for providing proper care, education, nutrition and emotional support to these children which can 
            lead to their overall development.

   Old Age Homes :-
  </p>

  <div class="clearfix">
    <div class="gallery" onmouseover="fall2(this)" onmouseout="rise2(this)">
       <img src="pics/old1.png" class="imgclass">
       <div class="slid2">
         <div class="abt1">
          <p style="padding-left: 10px; padding-right: 10px;">
           An old age home is a shelter house where the people of older age live together, when they are abandoned by their families or are admitted voluntarily. Here, these senior citizens are helped with their daily needs. <br>
           Although leaving beloved parents in old age homes is certainly not desirable, but then there are parents who suffer loss/death of their children, parents who are left alone because their children go to abroad, and these parents genuinely need someone to look after them at such a crucial time of their lives. 
          </p>
         </div>
       </div>

    </div>
    <div class="gallery" onmouseover="fall1(this)" onmouseout="rise1(this)">
      <img src="pics/old2.png" class="imgclass">
      <div class="slid1">
        <div class="abt1">
          <p style="padding-left: 10px; padding-right: 10px;">
          So while living in one's own home has no equally matching alternatives, Old age Homes are a much of a help and benifit to parents who really and geniunely need them. <br>
          Our foundation utilises the donations by kind hearts for the welfare of such parents. We help parents with their daily routines and needs by hiring staff. We also take true care of their medical health by regular health checkups and medications. Aparts from all these, we also host recreational activities so as to keep the beloved parents healthy, happy, stress-free and jolly.
